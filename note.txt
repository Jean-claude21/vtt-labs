Thank you for the clarification. I have now read the speckit.readme.md document.

Based on the documentation, speckit follows a five-phase workflow:

/speckit.constitution: Establishes project rules.
/speckit.specify: Defines the project's requirements.
/speckit.plan: Creates the technical plan and architecture.
/speckit.tasks: Breaks the plan into a task list.
/speckit.implement: Executes the tasks to write code.
You mentioned that you have already completed the constitution and specify phases and that the next step is to plan.
